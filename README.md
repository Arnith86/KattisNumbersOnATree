## Numbers on a Tree

This is my solution to the Kattis problem [Numbers on a Tree](https://open.kattis.com/problems/numbertree).

Two versions were created:

* A naive solution, where I initially overlooked the fact that $2^{30}$ is a very large number, resulting in a non-scalable approach.
* A mathematical solution that takes advantage of the properties of a binary tree, avoiding the need for a manual search.
